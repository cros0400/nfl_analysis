# Welcome to NFL Analysis

As a lover of sports and data science, I wanted to start a pet project where I take a look at NFL data from all angles. I will be exploring different questions about the NFL
and will be publishing Jupyter notebooks for anyone to follow along. 

This project is an effort to refine my ML skills while also working with utility modules like pandas, numpy, sklearn, etc. Throughout the notebooks, I will try to put some 
explanations that beginners may find useful. I will also attempt to label each of the notebooks based on the learning level of the content.
